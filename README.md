# X-Economy

This is a plugin for [X-Plane](http://x-plane.com), to connect and use [FSEconomy](http://www.fseconomy.net/).
The plugin uses Sandy Barbour's [Python interface](http://www.xpluginsdk.org/python_interface.htm), so plugin may work on Mac, Linux and Windows too.

This repository is outdated now. Further updates are closed and maintained by FSEconomy Team. See the link below to download the latest version.
